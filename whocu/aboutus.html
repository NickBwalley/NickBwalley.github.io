								<h2>About-Us</h2>
							</header>
							<p>With Hope Orphanage Centre Uganda  (WHOCU ) began in early 2017 as an initiative to support children (Orphans), neglected street kids with HIV/AIDS, refugees and kids with disabilities in Namutumba Town council/ District in Eastern Uganda.</p>

							<p>We began with seven total orphan children left alone with no support from an adult an were just surviving on community help by a few individuals who volunteered to give them food and clothing without education. We brought them in and took full responsibility of their lives providing all the basic needs to them.</p>

							<p>As of today we have 30 kids residential kids in our Centre and we have over 50 kids that we support from their guardian`s homes due to limited infrastructure at our Centre.</p>

							<p>Over the past 3 years the orphanage Centre has expanded from seven children in one village to over 80 children from the whole town council of namutumba district. A commitment is made to support each child by giving him/her strong education foundation, a good time, self-esteem and values and help them plan how they can earn a steady lively hood towards improving their standards of living in the future.</p>
